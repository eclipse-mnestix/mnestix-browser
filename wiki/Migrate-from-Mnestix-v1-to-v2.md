# Migrate from Mnestix v1 to v2:

If you are upgrading from a Mnestix-Browser version prior to 2.0.0, please note the following:

- On the first run of Mnestix 2.0.0, your database will be migrated to support Mnestix Infrastructures. Existing configured AAS and Submodel Repositories will be grouped into one infrastructure.
- Please review the created Infrastructure after the Migration in the settings and adjust them as needed.
- For storing security settings, we introduced an encryption key. Please set the environment variable SECRET_ENC_KEY, a value can be generated by `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"`.
- If you are still using Mnestix API 1.x, set `MNESTIX_V2_ENABLED` to false till you migrate your clients to the new Mnestix-Proxy and Mnestix-AAS-Generator.
- Please note that it is not possible to downgrade to a version prior to 2.0.0 after the migration without losing your configuration.
