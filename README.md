### Welcome to the Mnestix Community!

Mnestix Browser is an open source software designed to simplify the implementation of the Asset Administration Shell.
Together
with increasing contributions from users and developers, a growing community is working on further development under the
leadership of XITASO, a leading high-end software development company in the engineering industry.
Mnestix Browser is the perfect tool to demonstrate the power and potential of AAS (**Asset Administration Shells**) for
the
implementation of standardized digital twins. It opens the way for use cases such as the Digital Product Passport (DPP).

You can find a demo [here](https://mnestix-prod.azurewebsites.net/).
Some screenshots can be found in the [screenshots folder](screenshots).

```shell
docker compose up
```

## Feature Overview

The Mnestix Browser enables you to browse through the different AAS Dataspaces.
It allows you to **visualize Asset Administration Shells and their submodels**. It supports the AAS Metamodel and API in
version 3.

You configure the endpoint of an AAS repository and browse the different AAS, if a Discovery Service is available, it is
also possible to search for AssetIds and visualize the corresponding AAS.

Mnestix AAS Browser is also **optimized for mobile view** to have a **great user experience** on mobile phones.

Mnestix can **visualize every submodel** even if it is not standardized by IDTA. There are some submodels **visualized
in an extra user-friendly manner**. These are:

- Digital Nameplate
- Handover Documentation
- Carbon Footprint
- **and more!**

Moreover, dedicated visualizations for submodels can be added as a further feature.
